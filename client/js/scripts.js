	description: "Aries, (Latin: “Ram”) in astronomy, zodiacal constellation in the northern sky lying between Pisces and Taurus, at about 3 hours right ascension and 20° north declination. In astrology, Aries is the first sign of the zodiac, considered as governing the period from about March 21 to about April 19. Its representation as a ram is identified with the Egyptian god Amon and, in Greek mythology, with the ram with the golden fleece, on the back of which Phrixus, the son of King Athamas, safely fled Thessaly to Colchis, where he sacrificed the ram to Zeus, who placed it in the heavens as the constellation. The ram’s golden fleece was recovered by Jason, leader of the Argonauts."

	description: "Taurus, (Latin: “Bull”) in astronomy, zodiacal constellation lying in the northern sky between Aries and Gemini, at about 4 hours 20 minutes right ascension and 16° north declination. The constellation’s brightest star, Aldebaran (Arabic for “the follower”; also called Alpha Tauri), is the 14th brightest star in the sky, with a magnitude of 0.85. The constellation also contains the Crab Nebula (M1) and the Pleiades and Hyades star clusters. In astrology, Taurus is the second sign of the zodiac, considered as governing that portion of the year from about April 20 to about May 20. Its representation as a bull is related to the Greek myth of Zeus, who assumed the form of a bull to abduct Europa."

	description: "Gemini, (Latin: “Twins”) in astronomy, zodiacal constellation lying in the northern sky between Cancer and Taurus, at about 7 hours right ascension and 22° north declination. Its brightest stars are Castor and Pollux (Alpha and Beta Geminorum); Pollux is the brighter of the two, with a magnitude of 1.15, and is the 17th brightest star in the sky. The summer solstice, the northernmost point reached by the Sun in its annual apparent journey among the stars, lies in Gemini. This constellation also contains the isolated pulsar Geminga. In astrology, Gemini is the third sign of the zodiac, considered as governing the period from about May 21 to about June 21. It is represented by a set of twins (or in Egyptian astrology by a pair of goats and in Arabian astrology by a pair of peacocks). In addition to their identification as Castor and Pollux, the twins have also been related to other celebrated pairs, such as the younger and older Horus or Romulus and Remus."

	description: "Cancer, (Latin: “Crab”) in astronomy, zodiacal constellation lying in the northern sky between Leo and Gemini, at about 8 hours 25 minutes right ascension and 20° north declination. It contains the well-known star cluster called Praesepe, or the Beehive. Its brighest star, Al Tarf (Arabic for “the end” [of one of the crab’s legs]), also called Beta Cancri, is quite dim, with a magnitude of 3.6."

Regulus (Latin for “little king”; also called Alpha Leonis), the brightest star, is of magnitude 1.35. The November meteor shower called the Leonids has its radiant, or point of apparent origin, in Leo. Many of the stars in Leo form an asterism called the Sickle."

The constellation’s brightest star, Spica (Latin for “head of grain,” also called Alpha Virginis), is the 15th brightest star in the sky, with a magnitude of 1.04. Virgo contains the nearest large cluster of galaxies, the Virgo cluster, in which is located the giant elliptical galaxy Virgo A and PSR 1257+12, the pulsar around which the first extrasolar planets were discovered in 1992."

	description: "Libra, (Latin: “Balance”) in astronomy, zodiacal constellation in the southern sky lying between Scorpius and Virgo, at about 15 hours 30 minutes right ascension and 15° south declination. Its stars are faint; the brightest star, Zubeneschamali (Arabic for “northern claw,” as it was earlier regarded as part of Scorpius; also called Beta Librae), has a magnitude of 2.6."

	description: "Scorpius, (Latin: “Scorpion”) also called Scorpio, in astronomy, zodiacal constellation lying in the southern sky between Libra and Sagittarius, at about 16 hours 30 minutes right ascension and 30° south declination. Its brightest star, Antares (Alpha Scorpii), the 15th brightest star in the sky, has a magnitude of 1.1. Its name comes from the Greek for “rival of Ares” (i.e., rival of the planet Mars) and was probably given because of the star’s red colour and brightness. The brightest X-ray source in the sky, Scorpius X-1, is found in this constellation."

The centre of the Milky Way Galaxy lies in the radio source Sagittarius A*. Near the western border of Sagittarius is the winter solstice, the southernmost point reached by the Sun in its apparent annual journey among the stars. This constellation also contains the Lagoon and Trifid nebulas. The brightest star is Kaus Australis (from the Arabic for “bow” and the Latin for “southern,” respectively; it is also called Epsilon Sagittarii), with a magnitude of 1.9.

The constellation contains only faint stars without any striking grouping; the brightest star, Eta Piscium, has a magnitude of 3.6."
